mkdir vagrant-dev

cd vagrant-dev

vagrant init

VagrantFile

config.vm.box is the box to be configured from the vagrant cloud

config.vm.box_check_update provides warnings if new version is available for the public VM


Vagrant synched folders:

vagrant ssh

ls /vagrant
	- Vagrantfile

Vagrant automatically creates this in the running box and syncs

vagrant.vm.synced_folder maps first folder data in your host machine to VM box

vagrant reload (shortcut to run vagrant halt and vagrant up)
 	- there might be Linux - Ubuntu text encoding issues 

Vagrant Networking:

Port Forwarding
Private Networks
Public Networks

Port - is a number 1 and 65555 assigned to a TCP Packet

Known Ports
21 - FTP
80 - HTTP
443 - HTTPS/TLS

Port Forwarding:

connect to box

sudo apt-get install -y nginx
to test: curl localhost
open browser: localhost:8080 (error)

because no application on your host system listening on port 8080


config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"

open browser: localhost:8080

- you will see default ngnix page running in ubuntu vagrant box

Port Forwarding allows to access applications running in box from host.
