 What if there were a single command line program 
 using a single file format to build, run, and manage any VM?

- It is called Vagrant

Installation: 

1. Download Oracle VM VirtualBox and Install it
2. Install Vagrant

Why Vagrant?

 1. Developers use Vagrant to preserve purpose-built 
 isolated development environments.

 2. A Vagrant VM is frozen in time so to speak. 
 A developer can load a collection of tools and libraries 
 used to build a version of software and keep it indefinitely. 
 
 3. One, two, or even five years later, any developer 
 can run that VM and build that old software version.

 Components:
 
 1. CLI 
 2. Vagrant Cloud - HashiCorp provides Public Virtual Machines
 3. VagrantFiles
